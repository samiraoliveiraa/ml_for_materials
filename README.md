## Relevance of local attributes in machine learning for formation energy
**Samira de Oliveira Moreira, Felipe Crasto de Lima**

Materials have played an essential role in everyday life since the beginning of human history. Improvements in quality of life and technological development have only been possible due to advancements in the discovery and characterization of materials. Over time, this discovery process has undergone several modifications, passing through different paradigms in materials science. Initially based solely on empirical and experimental approaches, it progressively incorporated theoretical models, computational simulations, and, more recently, data science techniques driven by the vast amount of information generated by these methods. However, although many machine learning models have been developed with high efficiency, their interpretability is limited due to the large number of parameters involved. In this context, given that a materialâ€™s Hamiltonian can be defined based on atomic positions, it is reasonable to assume that a model could identify correlations between atomic structure and physical properties. Therefore, this work proposes the development of an interpretable model using symbolic regression to predict the formation energy of materials based solely on their local attributes. This approach enhances the understanding of structure-property relationships, enabling a more precise search for new materials.
